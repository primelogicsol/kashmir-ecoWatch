                    This platform is not a simple informational website. It is a structured digital environment designed to organize, interpret, present, and manage environmental intelligence, evidence systems, geospatial knowledge, monitoring workflows, district-level environmental understanding, public contribution pathways, and institutional information access across Kashmir. As such, both the visible and underlying components of the platform should be treated as protected intellectual and digital property.
